\section{General Information}

This section provides general information for TheLenaProject.

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this project, is to re-implement the open source image processing project Marvin Frameworks. This Java framework allows clients to upload and process normal photos, into elegant images by applying one of the various filters available in our application, much like Instagram does. Once properly implemented, the processed image will then be available to export as an image file for use in social media, advertisements, etc.

\subsection{Scope}

This Test Plan is focused on describing how each test case should be constructed and implemented, showing appropriate inputs and expected outputs. It will not go in-depth how each function being tested is implemented

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This test plan document for TheLenaProject revision 0, will primarily be responsible for addressing the testing planning of the various functions implemented within our project.

\section{Plan}

This section outlines the plan for TheLenaProject
	
\subsection{Software Description}

The software of this project applies a Java framework that allows clients to upload and process normal photos, into elegant images by applying one of the various filters available in our application, much like Instagram does. Once properly implemented, the processed image will then be available to export as an image file for use in social media, advertisements, etc.

\subsection{Test Team}

The following project members are responsible for all procedures of the validation
process including writing and executing tests:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Nezar Dimitri}
\item{Abeed Alibhai}
\item{Rahul Bablani}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

Automated testing will be conducted using JUnit and will be used to test major functions.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
\begin{itemize}
\item J-Unit will be implemented as the primary testing framework to run tests on all sections of the code.
\item Different images and file types will be used to test the file input and output of the application.
\item Black box testing will be done on Windows, Mac, and Linux based operating systems to ensure all functional and non-functional requirements are fulfilled on all platforms.
\item To report and measure Java code coverage we will use the tool JCov. JCov is capable of reporting the following types of code coverage: Block coverage, Line coverage, Branch coverage, Method coverage.
\item For manual testing, we will be using Surveys for the focus
groups and word processing for keeping track of test cases.
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
			Compared to the existing implementation of the open source image processing project Marvin Frameworks we have added 3 major features that distinguish us from them. We have added a fairly simple but elegant interface that allows the user to import and export image files. The GUI is very simple to allow any regular computer user to easily navigate the application and successfully upload, customize and export their image.  Our application has also been customized to allow a single image to be processed more than once with multiple filters to allow such features as: grayscale, invert and edge detection all at once on one single image as well as being able to process a single filter multiple times to intensify the effect of the filter. We have finally implemented an exporting tool to save the image as a .png or .jpg file which the original Marvin Frameworks project did not include. Next steps will be to implement error handling methodologies and look into the addition of video processing which may be out of the scope for the time restriction we are limited too but may be a future implementation of our application.
\section{Unit Testing Plan}

This section provides information about the unit testing plan within our project.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

Our project as of now has one internal function (besides the "main" function).
This internal function is the \textbf{actionPerformed} function used to listen to the actions in the GUI. There are a series of if-statements for the logic connecting each button to the correct plug-ins, and subsequently applying the correct filters to the image, resetting the image back to it original state, or prompting the user to save the edited image whilst choosing a name and a destination for it.

There are 3 types of buttons associated to the GUI: filter buttons, a reset button, and a save button. The unit tests for this function will be reflected differently based on the type of button. For the filter buttons we will be testing the correctness of the filter applied based on the selected filter. We will test from different initial states, one where the photo is in its original state right before the filter is applied, and other where the photo has already been edited by another filter and the filter is being applied on top of that. The unit test will only pass if the correctly selected filter was applied without making any other alterations to the photo. The second type of button is the reset button, the unit test for this will be testing the correctness of the "reset" from any initial state and will only pass if the image is is fully restored to its original state. The final type of button is the save button. There will be two unit tests for this. The first one will be testing the checking if the user is prompted with the export interface to save their edited image, and will only pass if the interface is made available for the user. The second unit test is linked to the output files and will be explained in the next subsection (6.2 Unit testing of output files).
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		

The only output file generated in this project is the processed version of the image that the user desires to save to their local drive. This is possible through the save button, which subsequently prompts the user with the export interface where they can select the image type, destination folder, and name of the finished product. The first unit test for the save button was discussed in the previous subsection (6.1 Unit testing of internal functions), but as stated there, there is a second unit test which is linked to the output files. This will be testing the reliability, compatibility, as well as the actual correctness of the output file. The unit test will pass if, after the prompting for export, the image is save with the correct formatting, with the right file path, and that the image is identical to how it looked in the preview window (with selected filters applied to it). This must consistently, work as well have some error handling to be able to notify the user if the selected format, file path, chosen name are invalid.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

We plan to hold a small beta test, targeting a wide variety of age groups and computer skill levels in order to determine the ease of usability for our application.  Such questions may be asked to our test group:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Does the application open on your computer? If so, how long does it take?
	\item Are you able to successfully upload and save your file?
	\item Are you able to successfully apply filter(s)?
	\item On a scale from 1-10 how appealing was the look of the app?
	\item How many clicks were needed to: open, filter and save an image
	\item How easy on a scale from 1-10 was the application to use?
	\item Any feedback on how to improve our application?
\end{itemize}
