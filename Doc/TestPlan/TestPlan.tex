\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this project, is to re-implement the open source image processing project Marvin Frameworks. This Java framework allows clients to upload and process normal photos, into elegant images by applying one of the various filters available in our application, much like Instagram does. Once properly implemented, the processed image will then be available to export as an image file for use in social media, advertisements, etc.

\subsection{Scope}

This Test Plan is focused on describing how each test case should be constructed and implemented, showing appropriate inputs and expected outputs. It will not go in-depth how each function being tested is implemented

Image Filter: & A software routine that changes the appearance of an image or part of an image by altering the shades and colours of the pixels in some manner. Filters are used to increase brightness and contrast as well as to add a wide variety of textures, tones and special effects to a picture.\\ 
Image \\ Processing: & The analysis and manipulation of a digitized image, especially in order to improve its quality. \\
\\Framework: & In computer programming, a framework is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality.\\
\\JUnit: & A unit testing framework for the Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development\\

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This test plan document for TheLenaProject revision 0, will primarily be responsible for addressing the testing planning of the various functions implemented within our project.

\subsection{Software Description}

\subsection{Test Team}

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

\subsection{Testing Tools}
\begin{itemize}
\item J-Unit will be implemented as the primary testing framework to run tests on all sections of the code.
\item Different images and file types will be used to test the file input and output of the application.
\item Black box testing will be done on Windows, Mac, and Linux based operating systems to ensure all functional and non-functional requirements are fulfilled on all platforms.
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
			Compared to the existing implementation of the open source image processing project Marvin Frameworks we have added 3 major features that distinguish us from them. We have added a fairly simple but elegant interface that allows the user to import and export image files. The GUI is very simple to allow any regular computer user to easily navigate the application and successfully upload, customize and export their image.  Our application has also been customized to allow a single image to be processed more than once with multiple filters to allow such features as: grayscale, invert and edge detection all at once on one single image as well as being able to process a single filter multiple times to intensify the effect of the filter. We have finally implemented an exporting tool to save the image as a .png or .jpg file which the original Marvin Frameworks project did not include. Next steps will be to implement error handling methodologies and look into the addition of video processing which may be out of the scope for the time restriction we are limited too but may be a future implementation of our application.

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This is a section that would be appropriate for some teams.
