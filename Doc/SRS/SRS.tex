This document describes the requirements for ....  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicity state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

\subsubsection{The Customers}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
\being{itemize}
\item This application’s user interface will be visually appealing and will operate seamlessly on any operating system.
\item The application will take a new approach on the way users edit and filter their photos, they will be able to achieve new and better results to attain the perfect image. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\being{itemize}
\item The software will have a simple UI that will allow for any individual no matter their age or familiarity with image processing to be able to use the application.\\
\item There will be no manual or guide on how to use the application, therefore The UI must be extremely intuitive to result in a plane learning curve.\\
\item The software will use a standard coding style and will be well documented for anyone interested in examining the code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
Speed
\being{itemize}
\item The app should take no longer than 3 seconds to load.
\item Users will be able to upload an image in a maximum of 2 seconds.
\item All interaction between a user and the UI will be instantaneous. Response times should not exceed ½ a second to complete any action. This includes all the different filters that are available.
\end{itemize}
Reliability
\begin{itemize}
\item For now we plan to release on desktop computer as this is a java application. Due to the nature of not actually needing a wireless connection nor connection to any server, the user can use this app freely, and whenever they see fit.
\item After taking the appropriate measures to accommodate for any risks that may arise during the use of the application, the program should not crash but instead send an error message if misused.
\end{itemize}
Quality
\begin{itemize}
\item Through no point in the image processing (including addition of filters and saving the new image) will the resolution be affected from its original value nor will any form of distortion occur.
\end{itemize}
Capacity
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to the local nature of the program and its independency from any sever there is no limit to the amount of people that may be processing there images.
\item Storage is based solely on the limitations of each individual user. The application can support processing of an unlimited number of photos.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
