This document describes the requirements for ....  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicity state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

\subsubsection{The Customers}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
\being{itemize}
\item This applicationâ€™s user interface will be visually appealing and will operate seamlessly on any operating system.
\item The application will take a new approach on the way users edit and filter their photos, they will be able to achieve new and better results to attain the perfect image. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\being{itemize}
\item The software will have a simple UI that will allow for any individual no matter their age or familiarity with image processing to be able to use the application.\\
\item There will be no manual or guide on how to use the application, therefore The UI must be extremely intuitive to result in a plane learning curve.\\
\item The software will use a standard coding style and will be well documented for anyone interested in examining the code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

\subsection{Risks}

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
