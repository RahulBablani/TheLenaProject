The Team is re inventing the open source project Marvin, which is a java Framework which takes in an image and proccess it into various filter. Our team has designed specific meeeting plans, means of communicaation and project schedule. Below is an outline of our Project Development Plan.


\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Due to similar schedules our team was able to plan solid meeting plans rather than on the fly meets. We have decided the priority meeting will be after the scheduled lab section. After lab section is when all the information is fresh in our head, we are focused on the project and we can finish any extra work we may not have completed in the lab. The second meeting is on sunday nights right before the week starts so work can be planned accordingly.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
The relationship dynamic between the three members is freinds so much time is spent together. Majority of our communication is though in person conversation. the secondary form of communication is through Facebook Messenger.

\section{Team Member Roles}
The project and all its task are being distributed evenly throughout the group. We do still have member roles, Rahul is our Project Manager. He over looks all activity and focuses on making sure all tasks are done on schedule. Abeed and Nezar are the main developers. Their main focus is on redeveloping the app, debugginh,  and ensuring it is more user friendly.

\section{Git Workflow Plan}
Feature Branch Workflow\\
We will have one Centralized Workflow with featuring branches. This promotes communication and collaboration between team members. All changes and edits will be done on each team members idividual branch. Once the change is done they will send a commit request which another team member will review and accept if they dont find any errors.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
There are many risks to redeveloping a program that already works. One of the tasks we are trying to accomplish is making the app more user freindly. While doing so, it is possible that we change part of the original framework thus rendering the image processing useless or incorrect. To prevent breaking the image processing framework, we plan on fully understanding the algorithms used within the framework as well implementing excessive step-by-step testing if any changes are needed to be made. In terms of redeveloping the GUI, we plan on making it much more user friendly, as well as adding an interface to allow the user to upload thier own images. A risk to this could be if your user is confused and uploads a wrong format type such as a pdf when an image file is required.

\section{Technology}
We are using Java to redevelop the program. We use the Marvin framework to process the images using different plugins for different filters. The Gui is constructed using J Panel. Laptops and Desktops are going to be used to build the program.

\section{Coding Style}
The language we are using to code this project is Java. The IDE we are going to be using is eclipse so our coding style will likely match the one enforced by Eclipse. Comments will be made for each method or any important functions in the code. We will seperate the plugins from any code developed by our team so we do not alter any orignial code from the Marvin Framwork.
