Our team is reinventing the open source project "Marvin Frameworks", which is a java Framework that takes in an image and proccess it into various photo filters. We have implemented an efficent agile work plan to schedule meeetings, establish a stable means of communication and develop a project schedule.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Due to the team having a similar class schedules we are able to easily arrange meetings and set standard weekly meeting times. We have decided the majority of meetings will occur after our lab section. After the lab is when we learned new topics that can be applied to our project and all of our questions have been asked thus, knowing exactly what we need to do. It is also great to finish any extra work we may not have completed in the lab. The second meeting will be held weekly on Sunday nights right before the week starts so work can be planned accordingly for the week ahead.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
Majority of our communication is though in person conversation due to the fact that we spend a lot of time together inside and outside of class time. The secondary form of communication is through online messangers such as: Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and text messages. In our meetings we will be logging what we talk about in each meeting in a private google document just to ensure we are on task and know what we need to complete for the upcoming weeks.

\section{Team Member Roles}
The project and all of its tasks will be distributed evenly throughout the group. We have assigned certain roles to make sure work is not overlapped and time is used effectively. Rahul is our Project Manager, he over sees all milestones and focuses on making sure all tasks are done on schedule while focusing on documentation but helping out with code as well. Abeed and Nezar will be the main developers, their main focus is on redeveloping the application, debugging,  and ensuring it is more user friendly.

\section{Git Workflow Plan}
Feature Branch Workflow\\
We will have one Centralized Workflow with featuring branches. This promotes communication and collaboration within the team. All changes and edits will be done on each team members individual branch. Once a the change is pushed they will send a commit request which then another team member will review and approve it if the work is error free.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
There are many risks to redeveloping a program that already works. One of the tasks we are trying to accomplish is making the application more user freindly by implementing categorized buttons. While doing so, it is possible that we change part of the original framework thus rendering the image processing useless or incorrect. To prevent breaking the image processing framework, we plan on fully analyzing the algorithms used within the framework as well implementing in depth step-by-step testing to see if changes are needed. In terms of redeveloping the GUI, we plan on making it much more user friendly, as well as adding an interface to allow the user to upload thier own images. A risk to this could be if your user is confused and uploads a wrong file format type such as a pdf when an image file is required.

\section{Technology}
We are using Java to redevelop the program. We will be using the Marvin framework to process the images using different plugins for different photo filters. The GUI will be constructed using JPanel. Laptops and Desktops are going to be used to build and execute the program.

\section{Coding Style}
The language we are using to code this project is Java. The IDE we are going to be using is Eclipse so our coding style will likely match the one enforced by Eclipse *Encapsulation? Info Hiding?*. Comments will be made for each method or any important functions in the code. We will seperate the plugins from any code developed by our team so we do not alter any orignial code from the Marvin Framwork.
